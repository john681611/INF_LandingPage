        <p>Welcome to the home of the Iron Fists clan. This is a brief description of our history and future goals.
            Iron Fists was formed on the 1st of July 1999. Being a member is at the very least a symbol of a quality player.
            We are all striving to make INF one of the best squad's around and things are going very well due to the excellent amount of hard work the squad continuously puts in.
            The long-term goals of INF are to constantly excel on the battlefield, build up our strength and resources and show people that we are as serious and solid as our name stands for.
            As time passes us by, it is important that we stay recognized as a squad that is organized and dangerous, yet one that puts friendship and fun at it’s heart.</p>
